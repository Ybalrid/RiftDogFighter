RiftDogFighter
==============

Free Little Dogfight game using Oculus Rift (http://oculusvr.com)


Using Annwvyn Engine https://github.com/Ybalrid/Annwvyn/

Please use lattest version available of Annwvyn compilled from sources.

This game is an attempt to enhance the engine. The developement of Annwvyn is in parallel of it. The original Idea was when I was playing an old game called Crimson Skies with a friend. I thought the basic physics of this kind of game is prety simple, It's a fun game, and I realy want to try something similar with an Oculus Rift. :smile:
